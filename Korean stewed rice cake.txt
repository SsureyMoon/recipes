Ingredients:
 - 1.1 lb(500g) of Korean rice cake for Tteokbokki, almost 40 rice cakes, 
 - 3 slices of thin Korean fish cakes, 
 - *1 package of instant ramen, 
 - 2 and a half large *table spoons of Korean pepper sauce,
 - 1 tablespoon of Korean pepper powder,
 - 1/4 of *a onion,
 - 2 Welsh onions,
 - a tablespoon of chopped garlic,
 - 3 teaspoons of cooking syrup,
 - 2 teaspoons of soy sauce,
 - half of a ramen base.
 * This dish serves 2. *

 Directions:
  1. Soak the rice cakes in water.

  2. Cut fish cakes in proper size to eat.

  3. Put 3 large cups of water in a pan and boil it.

  4. While the water is boiling, prepare vegetables.
     (1) Wash the Welsh-onions and the onion.
     (2) Cut the bottom of the Welsh-onion.
     (3) Peel the onion and split into quarters.
     (4) Chop Welsh-onions and onion.
     * If you have some lettuces, chop them too. *

  5. Boil the onion and Welsh-onion for flavor. 5 minutes from then, remove half of it.

  6. Welsh-onion can be separated into white ones and green ones. First, we put white ones in the pan, we put green ones in the dish at the end.

  7. Put rice cakes and fish cakes prepared in the pan.

  8. Put  Korean pepper sauce. we can control the spicy level  according to our preference.

  9. Put ramen a vegetable mix base and a half of powder base in the dish for flavor.

  10. Put cooking syrup. We can control how sweet it is.

  11. Boil it until half of water is left.

  12. If we want it to be more spicy, add Korean pepper powder.

  13. Ramen should be added at almost the end of the cooking, because the noodle will make Tteokbokki dry by absorbing water, if it is overcooked. I think 3 minutes is enough time to boil ramen.

  14. Add the green chopped Welsh-onion, which we have prepared before.

  15. Enjoy it.
